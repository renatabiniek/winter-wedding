### Forking to GitHub Repository

You can create a fork (copy) of the repository. This allows you to experiment with the code without affecting the original project.

To fork the repository:

1. Log in to your [GitHub](https://github.com/) account 
2. On GitHub, navigate to the repository you want to fork
3. In the top right corner of the page, underneath your profile avatar, click **Fork**
4. You should now have a copy of the original repository in your GitHub account

### Making a local clone

You can clone your repository to create a local copy on your computer. Any changes made to the local copy will not affect the original project. To clone the **Winter Wedding** project, follow the steps below:

1. Log in to your [GitHub](https://github.com/) account and locate the [Winter Wedding repository](https://github.com/renatabiniek/winter-wedding)
2. In the repository, click on **Code** button located above all the project files
3. Under HTTPS, copy the link generated (https://github.com/renatabiniek/winter-wedding.git)
4. Open the terminal you're using, e.g. Gitpod
5. Change the current working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory created
6. Type ```git clone``` and then paste the URL you copied earlier:  
```git clone https://github.com/renatabiniek/winter-wedding.git``` 
7. Press **Enter** to create your local clone.

You can also refer to this [GitHub documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository-from-github/cloning-a-repository) for detailed instructions.
